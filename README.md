# Digicode-system-using-vhdl
This project designs using vhdl a Digital access control system, this system is designed using MOORE fsm, and is synthesized down to the circuit level using alliance tool.

### Phase 1 of the Project
phase 1 discusses the design of the system and itâ€™s vhdl code, along with the testing strategy & the test bench of the system
[Phase 1 Report](phase%201%20report.pdf)
### Phase 2 of the Project
phase 2 discusses low-level synthesis of a Digital access control system, using alliance tool such as syf, boom, boog, loon
[Phase 2 Report](phase%202%20report.pdf)
### Phase 3 of the Project
phase 3 discusses covers the Physical Synthesis portion of a Digital access control system, using alliance tool such as ocp, nero, s2r
